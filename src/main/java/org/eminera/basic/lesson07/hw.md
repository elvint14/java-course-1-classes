1. User enters a number. Find `factorial` of this number `(multiplication of all numbers from 1 to number)` <br/>
ex. `input = 5 => factorial = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120`

2. User enters a number. Write a method which identify either this number is prime or not?<br/> 
ex. `5 is prime`, `12 is not prime`, `1 is neither prime nor non-prime`

3. User enters a number. Write a method to find sum of all digits of this number. <br/>
ex. `input = 12345 ==> sum = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15`

4. User enters a number. Write a method to find all the prime numbers from 2 to this number `(inclusive)` <br/>
ex. `input = 20 => output = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19`

5. Define and initialize an array. Find:
  - size of array
  - max element of array
  - min element of array
  - sum of all elements of array
  - average of array `(sum of all elements) / (count of all elements)`
